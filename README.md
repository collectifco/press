# Collectif

Collectif is an independent two-man design and branding studio based in Manitoba, Canada. 

Our design strategy starts with a conversation. We want to build a relationship with you. If we don’t know you, it’s difficult to build what you’re passionate about. Our process doesn’t fit in a box. It changes and evolves around the relationships we build with every partner.

Our small size reduces overhead and allows us to personally manage and design intentionally for each partnership. With Collectif, you’ll work directly with the designers building your project.

We want to work with you, not for you. We want to create something effective and beautiful. We want to make things better.

## Name

Heavily rooted in our Canadian identity, we looked to our rich French history for influence. 

Collectif is the French word for _collective_, which we chose for its collaborative significance. As a team, we are a collective, and we see ourselves as part of the client's own team, making the client–studio relationship a collective as well.
